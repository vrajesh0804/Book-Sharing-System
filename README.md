# Book-Sharing-System
Sharing books is the most basic form of sharing knowledge. But, sharing books, hand-to-hand may be a tedious and hardly convenient way. The project aims at providing an electronic medium to share books and provide readers with a platform to discuss the books. It uses the basics of day-to-day social transactions and incorporates them into a business model. It mostly delves into creating a conducive and beneficial environment for students. The system provides a platform for any student or faculties, particularly, who had books or stationery materials of the previous semester, which is no more use for them. Now, they would like to share it with other junior students that they might need it. As per our project, it can accomplish by developing an web application.
very good idea for colleage students.
